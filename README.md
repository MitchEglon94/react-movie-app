# Movie choice app - react project

I have built an app which will remove the pain of choosing a movie together; simply login, look through the movies and like the ones that catch your interest.

You can then go to the 'Followed Users' section and search for your desired user - this will then show up all of the movies that you and you search request have mutually liked.

Once you have watched a movie, on the main dashboard you will find your 'liked movies' section. You can mark movies here as watched and then this will remove them from your liked movies. 


I have a small mock server which can be found in my repo's and in there is some mock login data, user json server auth. 
It contains two user accounts currently and one admin account.

Up to now, the admin account is redundant but my following progress will be as follows:
- Add protected routes
- Add admin functionality to update/remove users
- A sign up form to add new users to the database
- Much better styling hopefully XD
